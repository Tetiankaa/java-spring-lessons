Idempotence refers to the property of an API operation where performing the same operation multiple times has the same effect as performing it once.
This means that regardless of how many times you invoke the operation with the same input parameters, the result remains the same.


An API specification, such as Swagger, is a formal document that describes the functionality, endpoints, request/response formats, and other details of an API.
It serves as a contract between the API provider and consumers, outlining how the API should be used and what behavior can be expected from it.
